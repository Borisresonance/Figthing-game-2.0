# Figthing-game-2.0
In this project I used all my accumulated knowdlege of JS and new knowledge from canvas
I had to separate the clases from the index because I had too much spaguetti code on the main file, I played a little bit with inheritance to share properties between
the clases, this was a lot of work and the project is still being build I have spend a lot of my free time into this specially learning the whole recursion frame animation
the canvas objects.
